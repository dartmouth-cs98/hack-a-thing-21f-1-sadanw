# Unreal Engine 4 Simple Game Tutorial


## What you built? 

I built a simple infinite tunnel game. The game involves using the mouse to navigate around obstacles, and it can be run from the unreal engine editor.

## What you learned

I learned the basics of using Unreal Engine 4, such as working with blueprints/materials and how to navigate its interface. It was more similar to Unity than I expected and was simple enough to pick up on; if I were to continue working with this, I would next want to do a hackathing using Unreal Engine in conjunction with C++/Visual Studio Code instead of only using the drag/drop node functions within the editor itself.
