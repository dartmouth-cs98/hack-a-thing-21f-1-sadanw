# Unreal Engine 4 Simple Game Tutorial


## What you built? 

I built a simple infinite tunnel game. The game involves using the mouse to navigate around obstacles, and it can be run from the unreal engine editor. Whenever an obstacle is hit, a little UI reset button appears that will start the game over.

Below is a screenshot of the reset button after having hit a wall; past the button you can see the next obstacle wall in the tunnel:

## What you learned

I learned the basics of using Unreal Engine 4, starting with installation and navigating the interface. From there, I reviewed some of the core components of Unreal including blueprints, materials, and built-in classes such as Controllers (non-physical objects that control pawns) and Pawns (objects that can be controlled). I also learned a bit about the workflow within Unreal, like compiling blueprints individually and learning how to read/debug errors.

Overall, Unreal Engine 4 was much more similar to Unity than I expected, and the similarities made it easier to pick up. On the plus side, Unreal has a lot of features built-in, so I did not need to download any extra packages or assets as I have often done in Unity. Also, the built-in visual code editor (blueprints) seems to have far more functionality than Unity's, and it actually creates a C++ class for the blueprint. That said, beyond the visual editor, I would likely prefer to code in C# (language used with Unity) rather than C++, as I am more confident with C# (especially in regards to memory management).

If I were to continue working with this, I would next want to do a hackathing using Unreal Engine in conjunction with C++/Visual Studio Code instead of only using the drag/drop node functions within the editor itself. I am curious to see how smoothly (or not) connecting code to the editor is, as well as if workflow between multiple coders is easy or if it causes problems.
